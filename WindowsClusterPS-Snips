# Powershell command to "flip" a Windows SOFS cluster from Prod to DR.  It reverses roles from the currently-active SOFS cluster "sofs-clst" 

# For a PLANNED failback, ideally run these commands interactively in administrative Powershell.  
# Before running the Set-SRPartnership command,
# run this command FROM SOFS-DR-D to ensure there are 0 bytes not yet synced:
# (Get-SRGroup).Replicas | Select-Object numofbytesremaining
# If it returns 0 bytes remaining, run the Set-SRPartnership command below.


# to the currently passive SOFS cluster "sofs-cl-dr"
# "rg01" and "rg02" are arbitrary Replication Group names created when Storage Replca was set up.
Set-SRPartnership -NewSourceComputerName sofs-cl-dr -SourceRGName rg02 -DestinationComputerName sofs-clst -DestinationRGName rg01 -Force

# To flip back to Prod, just reverse the command:
Set-SRPartnership -NewSourceComputerName sofs-clst -SourceRGName rg01 -DestinationComputerName sofs-cl-dr -DestinationRGName rg02 -Force
